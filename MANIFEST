# Because Docker has no chill and will vacuum up all files in the build context
# by default, *and* Docker won't let me symlink things selectively into a more
# narrowly-defined build context, this file enumerates all files that are
# visible to Docker.  If a file is to appear in the image, it must be listed
# here.  See also Rakefile.
